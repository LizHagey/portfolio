                    <figcaption>Rafting on the lower Salmon River is one of the best Attractions in the Idaho Mountains for families with young children. It's a 5 1/2 mile trip through the scenic lower Salmon River. This adventure begins at the outpost and ends at the lower Bridge. From there we bus you back up to the outpost. During your Salmon River rafting trip you will run about 50 class 1 and 2 rapids with one class 3 at the end. Water fights and splashing are very popular and kids absolutely love it, along with mom and dad. So if you're looking for something with a little less speed, this rafting trip on the Salmon River is for you. --Level: easy
