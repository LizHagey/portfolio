    <h2 class="aboutMeHead">About</h2>
    <p>I was born in Tennessee the youngest of 10 children and grew up in 
        many places because my father was in the Air Force.  I have lived 
        in Las Vegas, Nevada for 26 years and consider that my home.  
        I have had much life experience including raising a family, working
        as a legal assistant, coaching gymnastics/cheer, designing and 
        producing signs, and recently learning new skills by working 
        towards my degree of 'web design and development' through Brigham 
        Young University-Idaho online.</p>
    <p>I am a self-motivated, dependable person that has 8 years experience
        in designing but loves to develop websites as well. I have worked 
        in a variety of environments, and with many different kinds of 
        people, giving me qualities that would make me a great team member. 
        I am a hard worker evidenced by my good grades and positive 
        employer experiences. If I don't know how to do something then I study, 
        research, and work until I have figured it out. I find 
        satisfaction in doing so.</p>
    <h2 class="aboutMeHead">Education</h2>
    <p>In my younger years I went to Southern Utah University for 2 Â½ years on 
        a gymnastics scholarship. I was married and moved to Mississippi for my 
        husband to attend Law School, so I was unable to finish at that time.  
        Many years later I attended the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) for 
        1 year.  I then learned about the BYU-I online program and have done that 
        since. I am scheduled to graduate in July 2017!</p>
